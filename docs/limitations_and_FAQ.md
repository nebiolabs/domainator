# Limitations
## Large reference databases
Domainator currently loads reference databases into memory, so it is not suitable for large reference databases, for example it is suitable for annotating using Pfam as a reference with ~30,000 profiles, but not NCBI nr with millions of sequences.

 - What's with all the otters?
    - The Domainator mascot is Domainic, the Domain-otter. Domainic is a American river otter. Besides the irresistible pun and cuteness, the choice of an otter mascot was inspired by the river otters that live in the pond on the New England Biolabs Ipswich campus, where most of Domainator was written. You may see Domainic throughout our documentation, donning his detective gear as he investigates new proteins and genome neighborhoods. The otters holding hands as the M in our logo are a metaphor for a multidomain protein. Similar to the domains of many two-domain proteins, the individual otters are connected by a flexible linker, and can function independently when separated, but are happiest when they are together. While river otters are not known to hold hands, it's sea otters that exhibit that behavior, we hope you'll forgive our creative license in incorporating hand holding river otters into our logo.
